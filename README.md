## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter "libheif not found" errors, you may need to install libheif:
  - Windows: Use the precompiled binaries provided with pillow-heif
  - macOS: `brew install libheif`
  - Linux: `apt-get install libheif-dev` o `yum install libheif-devel`

- For document conversions:
  - Ensure Pandoc is installed and in the PATH for advanced conversions
  - For issues with password-protected PDFs, verify the entered password is correct
  - Some formats may require additional libraries; check the console for specific error messages

- If files are not converting, ensure they are valid and supported formats.
